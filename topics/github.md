## Actions (CI)

In order to receive notifications on workflow completion, see the `Actions` in the [account settings](https://github.com/settings/notifications).

### Ruby example

Reference: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides/building-and-testing-ruby.

Add a file named `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yml
# Note that this is not legal YAML (!)
#
name: Ruby CI

# https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#on
#
on:
  push:
    branches: [ $default-branch ]
  # Leave without values in order to to disable filtering.
  #
  pull_request:
  #
  # Other examples:
  #
  # page_build:
  # release:
  #   types: # This configuration does not affect the page_build event above
  #     - created

# Simplified form (also single string accepted)
#
# on: [push, pull_request]
#

jobs:
  test:
    # This doesn't guarantee a specific version, may run on the beforelast version.
    #
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstrategy
    #
    strategy:
      # Important! If true (default), failure of one job will stop all the other jobs.
      #
      fail-fast: false
      # In order to base the matrix on env vars, add `env: [K1=V1, ...]`, and add it to the step (see
      # below).
      #
      matrix: # optional
        os: [ubuntu, macos]
        ruby-version: [head, 3.0, 2.9, 2.8, 2.7, 2.6, 2.5]
    # `debug` is only to show the functionality - it's not included above.
    #
    continue-on-error: ${{ endsWith(matrix.ruby, 'head') || matrix.ruby == 'debug' }}
    # Conditionals can also be at step level.
    # When expressions are in an `if` key, curly braces are optional.
    #
    if: matrix.suite == 'rspec
    # See caching section.
    #
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - run: echo "ðŸ’¡ The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
    - name: Setup Ruby ${{ matrix.ruby-version }}
      uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
      if: ${{ matrix.suite == 'rspec' }}
      with:
        ruby-version: ${{ matrix.ruby-version }} # not needed if .ruby-version is present and used
        bundler-cache: true
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: bundle install
    - name: Run tests
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      run: bundle exec rspec
```

### Expressions

Expressions are wrapped in double curly braces: `{{ expression }}`.

### Variables

Contexts:

- `github.*`: information about the workflow/event ([reference](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#github-context))
  - `github.workspace`: where the repo is checked out
  - `github.event.number`: PR number ([reference](https://github.com/actions/checkout/issues/58#issuecomment-663103947))
  - `github.job`: job id (yaml key value)
- `secrets.<SECRET_NAME>`: secrets

There are environment variables, but must check the conditions, e.g. if they persist across jobs ([reference](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/environment-variables#default-environment-variables)):

- `env.GITHUB_WORKSPACE`
- `env.GITHUB_ENV`

In order to access variables/secrets from scripts, pass them via env (but predefined env vars are already available):

```yml
env:
  ENV_VAR_NAME: ${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}
```

`env` can also be defined in the top scope of the YAML file, which will set it for all the jobs.

In order to set and read variables across jobs, can do the following:

```yml
# Don't do this with process substitution, since failures are not detected!
#
# Reference: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/environment-variables#passing-values-between-steps-and-jobs-in-a-workflow
#
- run: echo "MYVAR=1" >> $GITHUB_ENV

# In case of process substitution, append to the github env vars inside the script:
#
# Step 1
# Have the script execute `echo RUN_CURRENT_SUITE=1 >> "$GITHUB_ENV"`
#
- run:  echo "script/ci/test_if_run_suite.sh ${{ github.job }}
# Step 2
- if: env.RUN_CURRENT_SUITE == 1
```

### Caching

Base caching:

```yml
# Will automatically run also after the job (to cache the data).

- uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: |
      ~/.cargo/registry
      ~/.cargo/git
      target
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-cargo-${{ hashFiles('**/Cargo.lock') }}
```

Ruby bundler caching is not trivial, so there's a specific action:

```yml
- uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
  with:
    ruby-version: ...
    bundler-cache: true
```

Other examples: https://github.com/actions/cache/blob/main/examples.md.

### Minimal example

```yml
name: CI

on: pull_request

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Test if current suite is run
      run:  echo "RUN_CURRENT_SUITE=$(script/ci/test_if_run_suite.sh "shellcheck")" >> $GITHUB_ENV
    - name: Run Shellcheck
      if: env.RUN_CURRENT_SUITE == 1
      run: script/ci/run_shellcheck.sh
```

### Cancel existing actions for the same PR (branch)

Use [this](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cancel-workflow-action):

```yml
jobs:
  cancel-previous-runs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Cancel Previous Runs
      uses: styfle/cancel-workflow-action@0.9.1
      with:
        access_token: ${{ github.token }}
  other-jobs:
#   ...
```

### tmate debuggin!

```yml
- name: Setup tmate session
  uses: mxschmitt/action-tmate@v3
```

### Rust CI action

Format/Clippy checks:

```yml
jobs:
  fmt:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Formatting
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Check Rust formatting
        uses: actions-rs/cargo@v1
        with:
          command: fmt
          args: --all -- --check
  # To improve: cache installation
  clippy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Linting
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install Clippy
        run: rustup component add clippy
      - name: Run Clippy
        run: cargo clippy
```

## Coauthorship (multiple authors)

Github's specification for coauthorship is to add each additional author in the commit message, in the format `Co-authored-by: Name <email>`. This is supported also by Gitlab.

## README.md

### Images

Display an image (WATCH OUT! This won't be rendered from external sites):

```md
![Highlighted block rendering](/readme_images/hightlighted_block_rendering.png?raw=true)
```

Image (raw) path: `https://github.com/64kramsystem/vscode-markdown-code-blocks-asm-syntax-highlighting/blob/master/pizza/test.png?raw=true`

### Link references

- Project root: prefix the path with `/../../` (see [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/40440270/210029))
- Current path: use the bare filename, without prefixes; the (dynamically generated) prefix `/blob/$current_branch/` will be automatically added

## Releases

Download the latest release of a repo (filtered by a certain file extension):

```sh
curl -sSL https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/mdBook/releases/latest | jq --raw-output '.assets[] | .browser_download_url' | grep 'linux-gnu.tar.gz$'
```

## Pages

It's possible to have only one subdomain per account, however, it's possible to have unlimited page sites in the path (e.g. `myaccount.github.io/mypages`):

- create a repository and go to `settings -> pages`
- the site root can be either the project root or `docs/`, but nothing else
