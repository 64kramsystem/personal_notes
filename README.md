## Personal notes

My personal software engineering notes (TIL).

The [topics directory](/../../tree/master/topics) includes the vast majority of the notes.

The tables of contents are generated by the [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) Visual Studio Code extension.  

A (legacy) GitHub hook for automatically generating TOCs on pre-commit is included in the repository.
