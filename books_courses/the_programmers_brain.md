## 2. Speed reading for code

Distinguish where errors come from:

- STM: lack of information (e.g. not knowing an API)
- LTM: lack of knowledge (e.g. not knowing an algorithm)

### Exercise 2.4: Iconic memory

Select a piece of code that is somewhat familiar to you. It can be something from your own codebase, or a small and simple piece of code from GitHub. It doesn’t matter all that much what code you select, or the programming language used. Something the size of half a page works best, and if possible, printing it on paper is encouraged.

Look at the code for a few seconds, then remove it from sight and try to answer the following questions:

- What is the structure of the code?
  - Is the code nested deeply or it is flat?
  - Are there any lines that stand out?
- How is whitespace used to structure the code?
  - Are there gaps in the code?
  - Are there large blobs of code?

### Exercise 2.5: Beacons

Select an unfamiliar codebase, but do select one in a programming language that you are familiar with. If possible, it would be great to do this exercise on a codebase where you know someone familiar with the details. You can then use that person as a judge of your understanding. In the codebase, select one method or function.

Study the selected code and try to summarize the meaning of the code.

Actively notice beacons that you use: Whenever you have an "aha" moment where you get a bit closer to the functionality of the code, stop and write down what it was that led you to that conclusion. This could be a comment, a variable name, a method name, or an intermediate value - all of those can be beacons.

Reflect: When you have a thorough understanding of the code and a list of beacons, reflect using these questions:

- What beacons have you collected?
- Are these code elements or natural language information?
- What knowledge do they represent?
- Do they represent knowledge about the domain of the code?
- Do they represent knowledge about the functionality of the code?

### Exercise 2.6: Code concepts (chunking) reproduction

Select a codebase you are somewhat familiar with—maybe something you work with regularly, but not mainly. It can also be something you personally wrote a while ago. Make sure you have at least some knowledge of the programming language the code is written in. You have to know more or less what the code does, but not know it intimately. You want to be in a situation similar to the chess players; they know the board and the pieces but not the setup. In the codebase, select a method or function, or another coherent piece of code roughly the size of half a page, with a maximum of 50 lines of code.

Study the selected code for a bit, for a maximum of two minutes. After the timer runs out, close or cover the code.

Take a piece of paper, or open a new file in your IDE, and try to recreate the code as best as you can.

When you are sure you have reproduced all the code you possibly can, open the original code and compare. Reflect using these questions:

- Which parts did you produce correctly with ease?
- Are there any parts of the code that you reproduced partly?
- Are there parts of the code that you missed entirely?
- Do you understand why you missed the lines that you did?
- Do the lines of code that you missed contain domain concepts that are unfamiliar to you?
